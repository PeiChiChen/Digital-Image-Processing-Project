# Digital-Image-Processing-Project
This project is the final project of the course "Introduction to Image Processing". The project includes three parts: Content-Aware Rotation, Color transfer, and Transportation Map Regularization.

Our theme combines Content-Aware Rotation, Color Transfer, and Transportation Map Regularization (TMR). Many images become skewed due to incorrect shooting angles or other factors, requiring Content-Aware Rotation for correction. Additionally, Color Transfer has many applications, one of the most common being photo filters used by nearly everyone. Finally, TMR can improve images flawed by Color Transfer. Based on this, we have decided to focus on these three themes.
